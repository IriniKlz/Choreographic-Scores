### Welcome message

Hello people :)

This workshop welcomes anyone interested in choreography and coding as scoring. We will approach programming and generative drawings as choreographic scores, and by extension, explore the affinity between choreographic and computational thinking. The session involves a practical engagement with generating digital drawings in [p5xjs](https://p5js.org) â€” a javascript library that makes coding accessible to new learners. Ready-made p5xjs sketches are provided below to tweak and play with, as a score-making process. After creating our own scores, we will bring them to life through interpreting them, dancing to them, and observing how technology can reconfigure the ways we communicate, archive, and transmit choreography.

Beware! You are not expected to become proficient coders within just a few hours, so do not get overwhelmed when you click on the following links and face a seeming chaos. Take it slowly! The idea is to get familiar with some fundamentals of coding, grasp the basics of computational thinking and imagine how this can inform your choreographic practice. 

### Ready-made p5xjs sketches

All code exists online, and more specifically, in the [online p5xjs editor](https://editor.p5js.org). You do not need to download anything - just work on your preferred browser. When you open the editor for the first time, make sure you **create an account and login to it**, so that you can save your sketches and be able to revisit them.

Here follows [a selection of sketches](https://editor.p5js.org/eri.kalaitzidi/collections/5OB5nicBh) that can be used for our score-making process, starting from simple ones and gradually building on their complexity:

### Possible ways to tweak the existing code

Keep in mind that you are creating some visual scores, so the idea is to play with any visual aspect of them. Some options include:

- changing the colour of the background, the strokes and the fill (you can use [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel))
- changing shapes (e.g. ellipse(), rect(), line() and other 2D primitives that can be found in the [p5xjs reference page](https://p5js.org/reference/))
- changing numbers and seeing how they affect the output (keep the original numbers on the side as a comment, so that you can reverse the changes you make). These numbers could relate to:
  - scale,
  - position,
  - speed, e.t.c.
- adding randomness to some parameters (through the [random()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/random/) or the [noise()](https://p5js.org/reference/p5/noise/) function)
